A table, set up in a room with wood paneling on the lower half of the wall and white walls above, is covered with a white cloth. The table features an assortment of pottery pieces, including bowls, mugs, plates, ornaments, and other items.

In the background, the wooden paneling adds warmth to the space. On top of the table, there are several Christmas-themed decorations such as candy canes and garlands, which add a festive touch to the overall setting.
