# devonpotteryguild.com

Source code for [devonpotteryguild.com], the website for the Devon Pottery
Guild, built with [lume.land](Lume).

I was originally tasked with rejigging the organization's website, formerly hosted on Weebly/Square.

The primary goals were that it be:

1. properly responsive on phones;
2. accessible (as in A11Y) --- good colour contrast, use semantic elements, etc.;
3. faster to load (i.e., lighter weight) that the previous solution; and
4. less expensive than the previous solution.

E-commerce (for membership fees and class registrations) wasn't a requirement.

I'm doing this in the open for:

- transparency with the Guild (this project and its ongoing stewardship is part of my volunteer contribution to the Guild);
- partially to get some learn in the open a little more about TypeScript and the serverless ecosystem; and
- [partially for longevity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).

Parts of the codebase could definitely use some tweaking. I was learning Lume from zero when I started, and naming, etc. can be a bit inconsistent.

## Design

Not the greatest, probably, but it's consistent and not bad by any stretch. The
colours are derived from the logo of the Town of Devon, as a bit of a nod to the
Guild's home and the majority of its members. The Town of Devon is one of the
Guild's most important financial contributors, too.

This hommage is not to be construed as an endorsement by the Town of Devon.

The font chosen is [Work Sans](https://weiweihuanghuang.github.io/Work-Sans/).
It's designed by Wei Huang, and published under the [Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&d=OFL).

I chose it in part because of the font's name --- "Work" resonates nicely with a ceramics guild.
