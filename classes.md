<p>
Pottery classes are a great way to relieve stress and enhance creativity while
learning a new skill! Participants will get a thorough introduction to the craft
of pottery making, have fun and interact with others while creating their own
ceramic pieces from start to finish.

## About our classes

The Guild's pottery classes normally run as 10-week sessions, and normally start
in September, January, and March.

We strive to get registration available at least two weeks before classes begin.

Classes are kept small, with most classes capped at 8 participants.

**All classes require a minimum of 5 students enrolled to proceed.[*](#refunds)**

Most classes are open to the public, and most of those classes are open to
beginners. Some additional classes and workshops are periodically made available
exclusively to Guild members.

**Unless otherwise noted, you must be at least 18 years old to join a class.**

(Similarly, Guild membership is only available to [adults](https://kings-printer.alberta.ca/1266.cfm?page=A06.cfm&leg_type=Acts&isbncln=0779700015&display=html).)

### Refunds

**There will be no refunds for class registration fees**, unless the class is
cancelled due to low enrolment.

If an Instructor cancels an individual class session (due to illness or
emergency) the Instructor will make up for it at a time to be agreed upon in
consultation with the class participants.

### Class location

All classes are held downstairs at the site of Devon's first school, just east of the current Robina Baker School, at:

### What about kids classes?

Unfortunately, the Devon Pottery Guild doesn't normally offer kids' classes
during the Septemberâ€“June season. We have run summer sessions for kids in the
past, and have this on our roadmap for serious consider in 2025, but nothing is
confirmed at this time.
